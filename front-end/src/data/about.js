    words: "One of the leading fields currently in artificial intelligence is natural language processing. Twitter offers an incredible amount of data of people’s interactions with various events, and this data can be used in a multitude of ways. In this project, we attempt to use several neural networks to perform sentiment analysis on tweets. Previous work on sentiment analysis in text has taken several different approaches, including bag of words, recurrent neural networks(Socher et.al, 2013), and recurrent neural networks combined with convolutional neural networks(Lai et.al, 2015).Given that tweets are limited to 240 characters, making them much shorter than other texts, it is unclear which of these approaches can perform best against this type of data.Because of this, we decided to compare 4 different approaches: a traditional bag of words approach, a recurrent neural network, a convolutional neural network, and a recurrent neural network combined with a convolutional one. The dataset we used was provided by SemEval - 2017. Each neural network includes a word embedding built on 56, 997 words.The dictionary of words was built from the text samples in our dataset, with common stop words removed and stemming applied.Each approach then has differing hidden layers as well as dropouts to prevent overfitting.The models are described in detail in figures 1-4. We also applied early - stopping to the networks, which halted learning when the validation loss started increasing rather than decreasing."

    words: "Each of the approaches performed fairly similarly, with the recurrent neural network having the highest average validation accuracy of 66.03%, and the bag of words approach reaching the highest overall validation accuracy in a single epoch with 70.65%. All of the networks began overfitting after 4 to 5 epochs, indicating the need for larger amounts of data. Ellis and Morgan (1999) have indicated that increasing the amount of training data and the number of classifiable parameters is the most viable route to improving speech recognition, and we assume that the same can apply for our situation. As our training data increases, so would the number of words that can be used in the embedding layer, increasing the classification parameters and improving the models."

    words: "As an extension of this project, we hope to gather more data, this time tagged for emotions, and extend upon our neural net to be able to classify tweets for emotions such as happiness, sadness, worry, surprise, and anger. A network like this could be used to further gauge people’s reactions to various events using social media."
